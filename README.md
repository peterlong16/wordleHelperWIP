# wordleHelperWIP
A companion app to assist in the solving of the daily 'Wordle' puzzle created by Josh Wardle

To use, type your word into the boxes, click the boxes to change the colour according to what Wordle says, click submit and the app will return 5 of it's best guesses for the answer.


NOTE: The program uses every five letter word in the dictionary as its dataset, more than what Wordle currently uses. This means some words maybe not be accepted by Wordle.
